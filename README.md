This is a cool fighting game based off of Rock Paper Scissors. I decided to be creative and put a little twist by keeping the core concept of Rock Paper Scissors but turning it into a retro-style fighting game with fight scenes, music, and hit sounds. It was difficult to program this at first but I'm learning a lot. Mark my words, I will be a software developer no matter what.
