TOP Rock Paper Scissors Project

This is a cool fighting game based off of Rock Paper Scissors. Rock Paper Scissors Project for The Odin Project Foundations Curriculum. I decided to be creative and put a little twist by keeping the core concept of Rock Paper Scissors but turning it into a fighting game. It was difficult to program this at first but I'm learning a lot. Mark my words, I will be a software developer no matter what.
